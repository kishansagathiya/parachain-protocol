# Introduction

## Why do we care? What are we trying to do?
The Primary purpose of polkadot is to provide security to parachains.
By providing security to parachains we mean
- validating
- authoring and
- finalizing
parachain blocks.

To do these task we need parachain protocol. It describes how relay chain nodes will talk to parachain nodes and include parachain blocks into relay chain.

# How do I know if a parachain block is authored or finalized?
